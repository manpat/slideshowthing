Hello

WTF am I talking aboot?

preface
	I can't speak for women since I am not one

I love programming
	I wrote this thing

	why?
		I like math, physics
		Controlled, predicatable (mostly)
		Unlike people

	Not uncommon betwixt the genders

	Female programmers not common tho

Fewer women programmers (specifically games)
	3% programmers
		shows in class/don't have to look far to see
		During months here I've met few female game designers
			Hard pressed to say I've met any female programmers


I know girls/women that share the same views/values
Why are there less in programming?
	wage gap
	harassment 
	few role models (chicken and egg?)
	social expectation
	generally shitty envionment


What can we do about it?/What's being done about it?
	All I can say is "please program"
	Scholarships for women, etc.
	
Thanks
